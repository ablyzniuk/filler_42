# filler_42
Its a project for school 42, in algo-branch.
Its a simple bot for a game "filler".
You can run it by using simple scripts for demo. (ex:sh big_map_01.sh) 
Its a version for demonstrations. Some additional functions are aviable if will run only a virtual machine without visual part.
All what you need its a cat sh-script and take only two commnands - "make && resources/filler_vm -p1 ./ablizniu.filler -p2 resources/players/carli.filler -v -f resources/maps/map02".
For other tips of VM use -h option.
If u will have any questions drunkenstein111333@gmail.com
